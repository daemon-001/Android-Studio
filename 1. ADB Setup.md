# ADB (Android Debug Bridge) Setup

## What is ADB?
Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a command-line tool that allows developers to communicate with an Android device for debugging, file transfer, and system management.

## Step 1: Download and Install ADB (No need if you installed Android Studio and its necessary SDKs)
1. **Download the Android SDK Platform Tools**
   - Visit the official link: [https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
   - Download the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. **Extract the ZIP file**
   - Extract the contents to a preferred location (e.g., `C:\adb` on Windows or `~/adb` on macOS/Linux).

## Step 2: Add ADB to System PATH (Optional)
### Windows:
1. Open **System Properties** (`Win + R`, then type `sysdm.cpl`).
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab and click **Environment Variables**.
3. Under **System Variables**, find `Path` and click **Edit**.
4. Click **New** and add the `platform-tools` folder path (e.g., `C:\adb\platform-tools`).
5. For Android Studio User `platform-tools` folder found in `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools`
6. Click **OK** and restart your PC.

### macOS/Linux:
1. Open a terminal and edit the shell profile file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).
2. Add the following line:
   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/adb/platform-tools
   ```
3. Save the file and apply changes:
   ```sh
   source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## Verify ADB 
1. Open command prompt and type `adb`
2. You see the output like this:
   ```sh
   Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41
   Version 35.0.2-12147458
   Installed as C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe
   Running on Windows 10.0.26100
   ...
   ```
3. If you see `'adb' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.` means the path is not set properly. Repeat the steps properly.

Now, ADB is set up and ready for debugging! ðŸš€
