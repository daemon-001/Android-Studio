### Option 2: Using a USB Cable (Alternative Method)
1. Connect your device to your PC via USB.
2. Run:
   ```sh
   adb tcpip 5555
   ```
3. Disconnect the USB cable.
4. Find your device's **IP address** from **Wi-Fi settings**.
5. Run:
   ```sh
   adb connect <device-ip>:5555
   ```
6. Verify the connection with:
   ```sh
   adb devices
   ```

## Step 4: Debug Your App Wirelessly
- Open Android Studio.
- Run your app on the connected device.
- Debug as usual without needing a USB cable.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network.
- Restart `adb` using:
  ```sh
  adb kill-server
  adb start-server
  ```
- Re-enable **Wireless Debugging** if the connection drops.
